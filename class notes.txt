There is one database! (the CDB)
There is one instance!

One DB:
One controlfile
One undo tablespace? (perhaps....)
One thread of redo
Common objects (Oracle supplied stuff)

One instance:
One set of backgrond processes
One SGA
One spfile

What is a PDB? (pluggable container)
A set of tablespaces
Include a system tablespace
Data dictionary defines all the objects within the PDB
Undo tablespace (unless using shared undo)
User tablespaces, segments for objects withing the PDB
A service, registered with the listener

The clever bit:
Users request a session against a service
listener maps the service to an isntance
the instance maps the session to the PDB
The scope of your session is limited to that PDB!!!
objects defined in the PDB's data dictionary
plus "common" objects shared from he root
